# telestion-extension-template

A template for creating new Telestion extensions.

This template contains an initialized project structure with configured dependencies and a publishing pipeline.

To fetch the dependencies locally you need a Github personal access token with `packages:read` rights.
Either add your github user name and the token as `GITHUB_ACTOR` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` to your environment variables 
or fill the `.github.credentials.template`.
