## Telestion Core packages

To download and use the [telestion-core](https://github.com/wuespace/telestion-core) packages, please create a
[personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
with the `packages:read` scope.
Next, copy the `gradle.properties.example` configuration file and name it `gradle.properties`.
Now fill in your GitHub username and the previously created PAT.
No worry, this file will not be committed at any time!

Finally, synchronize gradle to automatically download and set up the
[telestion-core](https://github.com/wuespace/telestion-core) packages.

## Intended Release Cycle

When you want to release a new application, go to the _Actions_ Tab in the GitHub UI and choose the `Release` Action.
Then click `Run workflow`.

This triggers the Release Action which automatically creates a Conventional Commit Release on GitHub.
Afterwards the subsequent build actions are triggered via:
```yml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Release"]
    types: [completed]
```

Additionally, if you want to upload release assets in these build workflows, you can use the cached build environment:
```yml
      - name: Download build environment ðŸ“¥
        uses: dawidd6/action-download-artifact@v2.14.0
        with:
          workflow: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.workflow_id }}
          workflow_conclusion: success
          name: build-env
          path: ${{ github.workspace }}

      - name: Import environment â›“
        run: cat .build-env >> $GITHUB_ENV

      - name: Upload release asset
        uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1.0.1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        with:
          upload_url: ${{ env.upload_url }}
          asset_path: ./dist/artifact1.txt
          asset_name: artifact1.txt
          asset_content_type: text/plain
```
